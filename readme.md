<h1>This is my roadmap to learn ReactJS.</h1>

<p>This project is a personal roadmap and I only did to share my lernings.</p>

##

<p> First of all, I would like to list what I already studied as basic skills that i thought  that would help me scalate faster my knowledge in React JS.

- [x] HTML (Writing Semantic HTML / HTML Basics  / Best practices / Acessibility...)

- [x] CSS ( All the CSS basics and a deep dive in CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox)

- [x] JavaScript ( Syntax, DOM, Arrow functions and more... )
</p>

<h3> Here are two projects that I have on GitHub that helped me improve the skills above.</h3>

##

<a  href="https://github.com/SamLeal/Calculattor-app">Calculator App</a>
<p> In  this project I practiced mostly CSS Grid, but it was very fun to do the calculator work, and very challenging  to make the theme button work. </p> 
<p> Other thing that I like in this project is that I already see improvements to do in its code and I planned to update it in the future. </p>

<h3>Now lets start learning React, I will do a checklist and mark what I already learned, and what I still in the way to learn.</h3>

- [x] Understanding how React works.
- [x] Training my skills building a <a href="https://github.com/SamLeal/Netflix-Clone-React.git">Netflix Clone</a>.
